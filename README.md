# Contiki-Cooja
Cooja is a network simulator for the ContikiOS. This tool can be used to carry out Sensor Network simulations.
Cooja provides us with a very smooth transition when it comes to simulating the TelosB motes running on TinyOS and then implementing and testing the same on hardware. The TelosB equivalent motes used for simulations are Sky Motes. The executable build file of the code is loaded onto the software and the number of motes required are chosen.


See https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/wiki/An-Introduction-to-Cooja for documentation.
