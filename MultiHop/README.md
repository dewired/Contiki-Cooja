A primary requirement in a wireless sensor network is that the motes consume minimal power. This limits their range of communication. But the motes in densely employed network can be used to the benefit by creating a multi hop network.
The codes attached were tested on TelosB motes to establish communication between three or more nodes.

The convention followed here is as follows:
MultiHopDest: for the destination node
MultiHopSource: for the source node
MultiHopInter: for the intermediate node(s)
